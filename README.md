# ANN-Code
Written a generalized computer code for a Multi-layer Feed Forward Neural Network
with Back Propagation Training algorithm. A Batch mode of training is carried out here. The Data is taken from online source 
which contains 3 inputs and 1 output.
Normalization is done wherever needed. Input is read from a file and outputs with Mean Square Error(MSE) and Error in prediction is written onto a file.
This repository contains the input file and the code for the Multi-layer Neural Network model.
